# Kaggle-Projects

I use these kernels to study more Data Analysis and optimize the programming before I commit them to Kaggle.


- `wisconsin.ipynb` an assignment I did on the Wisconsin cancer dataset, classifying Malignant and Benigne tumors. The goal was to use algorithms explicitly and not to rely on imported modules.

- `Chicago_crime_kernel.ipynb` : Exploration of using SQL and BigQuery and displaying geographical data. Also created an additional dataset containing the population per city district. Based on methods from the book `Hands-On	Machine	Learning	with Scikit-Learn	and	TensorFlow` by Aurélien	Géron.

- `Mushroom.ipynb` : Exploration of how to handle missing values in this dataset. Goal is to classify mushrooms as either poisonous or edible.
