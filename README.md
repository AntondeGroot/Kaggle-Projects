# Kaggle-Projects

these are some uncommitted Kaggle Kernels, or datasets not coming from Kaggle.

- `Mushroom.ipynb` : Exploration of how to handle missing values in this dataset. Goal is to classify mushrooms as either poisonous or edible.

- `Chicago_crime_kernel.ipynb` : Exploration of using SQL and BigQuery and displaying geographical data.

- `wisconsin.ipynb` an assignment I did on the Wisconsin cancer dataset, classifying Malignant and Benigne tumors. Exploration to use PCA from numpy manipulation and not from an imported module.
